<h2>COVERT CLAUSE STRUCTURE IN THE MISKITU NOUN PHRASE</h2>

<h3>Author's Note</h3>

<p>
This is a preliminary web conversion of my unpublished MIT Syntax
Generals paper.  The original was (I think) from 1992, and was coded
in LaTeX and had a bunch of hand-drawn trees, which prevented it from
being readily disseminated electronically.  In 2002 and 2003 I spent a
bunch of time converting the paper to a TEI XML document type and then
outputting an HTML-rendered version.  From what I remember, I was
supposed to be drastically shortening it for publication in WANI, but
never got that far.  I believe I may have made some small editorial
changes in the process, but certainly nothing substantive.  Of course,
I set aside the project before it was finished.  For instance, there
are no trees at all anymore, but there are equivalent bracket-marked
structures in their place.  I know I was planning to convert most of
those bracket notations into SVG-generated tree images, but never got
around to it.  This is a big deal because I think some of the larger
bracket expressions are completely impenetrable and do not illustrate
the points well.  So for the time being you'll have to draw out the
trees yourself if you care enough about figuring it out!  The other
problem I notice is that it looks like I never got the section refs to
resolve right (so the number in a section reference is just blank).
There are other formatting issues that never got resolved too, but all
in all, it looks like the content came through relatively intact.
Feel free to let me know if you find any other glaring problems.

So <a href="paper.html">here is the paper</a> in its current
incarnation, last touched in February, 2003.  Don't ask me how it
should be cited, since I am not affiliated with any institution
anymore.  I will try to make sure that this URL, <a
href="http://www.slaxicon.org/papers/miskdp/2003-02/">http://www.slaxicon.org/papers/miskdp/2003-02/</a>
remains stable and always points to exactly this version; if I do make
future updates, I will put the new version(s) in a different place and
link to it here.
