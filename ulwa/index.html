<p>Ulwa is
a <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/misumalpan-0">Misumalpan</a>
language spoken in the Eastern (Atlantic) region
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>.
The Misumalpan languages
include <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=MIQ">Miskitu</a>,
the now
extinct <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=MTN">Matagalpa</a>-<a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=CCR">Cacaopera</a>,
and the
small <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=SUM">Sumu</a>
language subgroup, exemplified today only by Ulwa (spoken in the
community of Karawala in the Southern Atlantic Autonomous
Region---R.A.A.S.), and its close cousin, Mayangna, spoken by a few
thousand people in the Northern Atlantic Autonomous Region (R.A.A.N.)
of Nicaragua as well as along the RÃ­o Patuca in Honduras.  The shaded
area on the map approximates the original territory of the Ulwa people
before European contact.  Today the only significant remaining
population resides in the village of Karawala.  Here the language is
still spoken by some 400 people, although very few of these are
children.</p>
